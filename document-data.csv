51,"Guidewater jkt - Pounding into the teeth of a nor'easter or swinging tips through the deluge  the Guidewater keeps you fishing comfortably long after other anglers have headed for the barn. We combined our best knowledge of fabrics, design and technology to create a full-featured, highly technical piece of angling equipment. Waterproof/breathable 3-layer stretch nylon, along with a two-inch longer cut, make this the shell of choice for skiff, bay boat and jet sled guides. Although the design ethic is minimalist, ergonomically placed pockets and custom-engineered ""fish pulls"" (which vastly improve waterproof reverse-coil zipper function) put everything you need at your fingertips. In other words, you can retire your vest. The tuck-away hood won't flap in the wind, and the brushed-fleece lined collar provides decadent comfort. More fishing-specific details: glued-in waterproof zippers, drain holes in hem and pockets, attachment patch, forceps/glasses loop, modified reversed StretchCoat cuffs, rod holder.
