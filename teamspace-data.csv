1,"Will using Team Space take a lot of time? - No, Team Space is not a cumbersome platform.It will take less than five minutes to complete Check-Ins in the platform, and an additional 10 - 15 minutes to have the Check-In conversation. Team leaders will spend just two-three minutes reviewing each of their team member&apos;s priorities to prepare for their conversations.Team Leaders should launch an Engagement Pulse when they create a team, and subsequently, quarterly. This will take each team member less than five minutes to fill out. Team leaders will also fill out a Performance Snapshot for their team members monthly. These take about two minutes per team member."
2,"Is Team Space voluntary? - We expect that team leaders and team members across Cisco will find this technology useful in their work, and will want to be active users of it. All static (hierarchy) teams will be added to the system automatically. We expect that every employee will take the assessment and enter the system. And, beyond that, our intent is that participation is voluntary - we will be aiming to show the benefits of Team Space to employees and team leaders, so that they understand what it offers them, and encouraging, but not mandating, their participation."
3,"What is a StandOut Assessment? - An assessment of innate patterns of thought, feeling and behavior measuring nine combinations called Strength Roles. The assessment uses a situational judgment test to measure what actions the person would take during each situation or scenario. The assessment highlights the top two Strength Roles, which can then be used to identify concrete actions specifically tailored to help accelerate performance."
4,"Why StandOut Assessment? - The primary application of the StandOut assessment is to evaluate an individual&apos;s strengths Roles (combinations of dominant patterns of thought, feeling and behavior that can be productively applied) and then provide targeted development strategies for using those strength Roles at work."
5,"Can I retake the StandOut Assessment? - You won&apos;t be able to retake the StandOut assessment once you&apos;ve completed it. There are several reasons why the assessment is only given once:- you are forced to react instinctively, using a timer;- it is designed to capture how you act rather than how you would calculate a response;- it describes how you show up to others rather than your self-perception.If you find you disagree with the results of the StandOut assessment, first ask people who know you if they agree with your Strength Roles. They can help confirm if your self-perception matches how you are perceived by others. Also, take some time to talk with others with the same Strength Roles; everyone is unique and you will find the Strength Roles showing up differently for each of you."
6,"What is the alignment, if any, between the StandOut Assessment Strength Roles and the Strengths finder Talent themes? - SF identified the 34 most common innate traits and tendencies that people could express and pointed out each person&apos;s Top 5 talent themes.StandOut sharpens the focus, using statistical analysis to align the original 34 talent themes into the 9 most common &quot;Strength Roles&quot; - those ways in which a person&apos;s recurring patterns and traits tend to express themselves in action.StandOut pays special attention to a person&apos;s Top 2 Roles as the most important factor in determining his or her comparative advantage."
7,"Why are there only 9 themes in StandOut? - StandOut analyzed the many hundreds of themes that are possible to measure and identified the most common and powerful theme combinations. They found that certain themes cluster into frequently occurring patterns which were ultimately identified as the nine talent roles. These findings were then validated through testing with just under 1 quarter of a million people before being introduced in StandOut."
8,"What is the benefit of using SO rather than SF for team leaders? - StandOut provides an integrated system for organizations that connects individual strengths with organizational goals, positions people to find their edge and heightens an organization&apos;s effort to succeed through their people.StandOut integrated system provides ongoing tips and team leader functionality that links team member assessment results to create a picture of an entire team&apos;s strengths."
9,"Why does the StandOut Assessment appears to be personal? - The primary application of StandOut Assessment is to evaluate an individual&apos;s strength Roles which consists of a combination of dominant patterns of thought, feelings and behavior. Intentionally, the questions are designed from impact moments in life where a person&apos;s preexisting skills or technical knowledge would have minimal relevance to response options. While the situations on the Standout Assessment often refer to a spouse or partner, the purpose is to understand how an individual would react with a person that they care about. As an example, one question on the Standout Assessment asks &quot;which of the following strengths you would give to your spouse or partner&quot; and a list is provided. The ultimate purpose of this question is to ascertain what an individual believes is one of their strengths."
10,"How is the StandOut Assessment results being used and/or shared? - <span>No one will be able to see your responses to the questions in the Assessment, only the resultant top two strength Roles will be visible. There are also no right or wrong strength Roles and the intent is to help you and others understand how you will show up and be at your best in your team. More information on who sees what data in Team Space can be found here: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" data-containerid="35217" data-containertype="700" data-objectid="1408024" data-objecttype="102" href="https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1408024">https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1408024</a>"
11,"What is my Snapshot? - A place to share our accomplishments, passions, aspirations and strengths. Team leaders and members can go to your Snapshot to learn how to best collaborate with you, understand your strengths through your greatest value statements &quot;come to me when&quot; and &quot;how to work best with me.&quot;"
12,"How do I use My Snapshot to communicate my strengths and passions with my team? - Use My Snapshot to share your strengths and expertise with your teammates and team leaders. You can also post photos, comments, or links to current projects, accomplishments and career goals."
13,"What is a Check-in? - A ritual to capture key priorities and information about your work, set a focus for conversations, and save time for team members and team leaders. It is not a replacement for conversation; follow-up is important, based on check-in priorities and what is most impactful for the team member. Each check-in consists of several key items:- Priorities: the most important work items for the coming week- Pulse: your opportunities to use your strengths and deliver value- Needs: what you need from your team leaders in the coming week- Loves and loathes: the tasks that energized you, and those that didn&apos;tThese items are intended to gather a clear and accurate view on how we are experiencing our job on a real-time basis."
14,"Are Check-Ins required? - <span>While Check-Ins are not &quot;mandatory,&quot; they are the essence of Team Space. By completing your Check-In in the platform, the information is captured to drive the conversations about the work between team leaders and team members. Check-Ins conversation can be done in numerous of ways. For example, live conversations, jabber message, emails, etc. You will get a couple of reminders from Team Space to check in each week. If you miss one, you won&apos;t be able to go back and edit any information for that week (e.g. priorities or needs). For more information, check out the <a class="jive-link-blog-small" data-containerid="39198" data-containertype="37" data-objectid="49050" data-objecttype="38" href="https://cisco.jiveon.com/groups/team-space/blog/2016/03/14/check-ins-quite-literally-or-maybe-not">blog</a>.</span>"
15,"How is a Check-In different from 1:1 or Sync Up conversation? - A Check-In is different from 1:1 and Sync Up conversations in that it must happen each week and the content is specific. Length does not matter as long as you discuss priorities for the week, what you need from your leader to be your best as you work, and what you loved and loathed about the previous week. You will also use the Check-In tool in Team Space to capture this information in preparation for your conversation.Having these conversations weekly helps us continually move toward our strengths and work faster and more effectively."
16,"Who should I Check-In with? - Team Space lets you decide which team leaders you&apos;d like to share your Check-Ins in with. You can also select how which information you&apos;d like to share with which team leaders. The team leaders with whom you have conversations may vary, depending on the team and your priorities. When you complete a Check-In, the information you provide goes to the leaders you&apos;ve opted to share with. This way they can see the full breadth of your work."
17,"Can I modify a Check-In? - You can update specific parts of a current check-in, such as your priorities or needs. You cannot edit the pulse, loves or loathes, or previous Check-Ins."
18,"Who can see my Check-Ins data? - Team members can control how their check-in is shared with each team leader. (Note that you only complete one check-in each week, you choose what each team leader can see, and decide which of your priorities are appropriate to discuss with each team leader.) Team members can share priorities, pulse, or both. By default sharing is turned on when you join a team. Certain data will be rolled up in aggregate functionally (and anonymously) to capture business metrics for the Team Space platform."
19,"I am required to Check-In if I am on LOA or PTO? - No, you are not required to Check In when on LOA or PTO."
20,"When do I do my check-in? - Check-ins are weekly and can be completed and submitted Friday - through Thursday. Check-ins can be submitted at any time in that week. When a new check-in week begins, users receive notifications on Fridays 8:00am and reminders on Mondays 8:00 am your local time. If you enter and submit your check-in on Friday, then you have completed your check-in for the week. You cannot modify and/or edit the Love/Loathed section once you&apos;ve submitted your check-in. However, you can edit the Needs and Priorities sections of your check in. If you miss the check-in window by Thursday, the option to submit a check-in is no longer available for that week. On Friday a new week begins and you will receive a new notification to complete your check-in for the week.

21,"How many check-ins do I have to complete each week? - One check in per week. For your dynamic team leader, you can choose which part of your check-in (priorities, loved/loathe, needs) to share.<br>All three parts of your check in is automatically shared with your static team leader."
22,"Can I share my priorities with other members of my team? - Team Space allows you to share your Check-In information only with your team leaders. The information you post on your My Snapshot page is visible to all Team Space users."
23,"What is an Engagement Pulse? - A survey of team members launched by the team leader. The survey asks ten questions that focus on the experience of the team at a moment in time. The questions address dimensions that predict team excellence. An Engagement Pulse survey is open for two weeks. If all team members complete the survey prior to the deadline, the survey will close and the results will be available to the team leader. A minimum of three team members must complete the survey, otherwise results will not be available due to lack of data. All individual&apos;s answers to the survey are anonymous. Team averages are shown in the survey results."
24,"When should team leaders launch an Engagement Pulse? - Team leaders should launch an Engagement Pulse once a quarter, or at any time that they would like to get engagement feedback from the team."
25,"What should I do if more than one team leader launches an Engagement Pulse at the same time? - Complete each survey based on your experience in each team."
26,"Who can see the results of the Engagement Pulse, and what will they see? - Only Team Leaders are able to get results of Engagement Pulse surveys from the Team Space platform. However, they can - and should - share the results with their team.Team Space will provide the aggregate response rate for the first eight questions in the Engagement Pulse report. These results can be compared with prior Engagement Pulse results for that team, as well as with national (external to Cisco) benchmarks.(The final two questions in the Pulse Survey will only be used to fine tune Team Space for Cisco. These questions are not part of the survey report, nor are they available for viewing in the platform)."
27,"What will we see once we\'ve completed an Engagement Pulse? - Team Space will provide the aggregate response rate for the first eight questions in the Engagement Pulse report, which can be viewed by each team leader. These eight questions can also be compared with prior engagement pulse survey for the same team and national external benchmarks. Team leaders can then share the report in an upcoming team meeting. The final two questions will be used as we tune Team Space to Cisco. These questions are not part of the survey report nor are they available for viewing in the tool. In the near future, we will provide the option for smaller teams with less than 3 members to participate in the engagement pulse and add their voice to the collective/aggregate view of organizations. However, we will not be producing Engagement Pulse reports for these teams, as with less than 3 team members&apos; results we see an increased risk in identification of who said what."
28,"Can a Senior Director see an aggregate Engagement Pulse for the entire organization? - No. The platform does not currently support aggregation of Engagement Pulse results from specific organizations.We are working to create a solution that provide visibility to aggregate data into CMMC. However, there will be no drill down to specific team results."
29,"Why are there 10 questions in the Engagement Pulse, while the platform only references 8? - 1. The 8 questions are static and have been proven to yield data that serves teams and team leaders.2. Questions 9 &amp; 10 are dynamic and have been added by the Cisco team. They have not been tested and until Engagement Pulse surveys are launched, we currently have no data to support them.3. Being dynamic in nature also means that questions 9 &amp; 10 will change to meet the needs of our Team Leaders. These questions for example, were built for the benefit of the I &amp; C team."
30,"What is a Performance Snapshot? - A way to gather a team leader&apos;s first hand and confidential assessment of the performance of a team member at a moment in time. The Performance Snapshot provides a perspective on the team members&apos; contributions to the company. The Performance Snapshot consists of four questions:1. I always go to _____ when I need extraordinary results.2. I choose to work with ______ as much as I possibly can.3. I would promote ______ today if I could.4. I think _____ has a performance problem that I need to address immediately.Learn more about <a class="jive-link-wiki-small" data-containerid="35217" data-containertype="700" data-objectid="1356650" data-objecttype="102" href="https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1356650#vid5">Performance Snapshot</a>."
31,"How often are Performance Snapshots completed? - Team leaders should complete a Performance Snapshot on each of their team members monthly."
32,"Who has access to Performance Snapshots? - Performance Snapshots are visible to team leader who completes them. <a class="jive-link-wiki-small" data-containerid="35217" data-containertype="700" data-objectid="1408024" data-objecttype="102" href="https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1408024"><span style="display: inline-block;">Learn more</span></a> about Performance Snapshot."
33,"Does the Performance Snapshot replace CPC? - No, it&apos;s very different. CPC was designed as a one-size-fits-all system that engaged us only once or twice a year. It focused our attention on managing average or low performance, with leaders spending countless hours documenting feedback that did not impact or assess future performance. With Team Space and the Performance Snapshot, we are building a performance practice that is one-size-fits-ONE. It&apos;s designed to lift performance through frequent, future-focused conversations about near-term work, to leverage our strengths and energize our people every day."
34,"What are the four questions in the Performance Snapshot? - Q1. I always go to &#x201C;Employee&#x201D; when I need extraordinary results? (Productivity)<br>Q2. I choose to work with &#x201C;Employee&#x201D; as much as I possibly can? (Teamwork)<br>Q3. I would promote &#x201C;Employee&#x201D; today if I could? (Potential)<br>Q4. I think &#x201C;Employee&#x201D; has a performance problem that I need to address immediately? (Risk)<br>There is also a Private Note Feature &#x2013; which allows the leader to add context around that snapshot and what was going on at the time."
35,"Are the questions in the Performance Snapshot valid? When I think of performance, I think of results and impact. The current set of Snapshot questions don\'t seem to capture this. Why not? - A significant body of research has demonstrated that traditional methods which ask one person to rate another person&apos;s skills or performance are notoriously flawed and unreliable. The most comprehensive research on what ratings actually measure was conducted by Michael Mount, Steven Scullen, and Maynard Goff and published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in 2000. They argue the &quot;Idiosyncratic Rater Effect&quot; tells us that my rating of you on a quality such as &quot;potential&quot; is driven not by who you are, but instead by my own idiosyncrasies: how I define &#x201C;potential&#x201D; how much of it I think I have, how tough a rater I usually am. On the flip-side, research shows that we are great at predicting our own future behaviors, after all we know ourselves well.The Performance Snapshot questions were designed to measure, reliably and frequently, what each team leader intends to do with each team member. The specific questions on Cisco&#x2019;s Performance Snapshot come from years of research by our Team Space partner, The Marcus Buckingham Company. The four questions in the Performance Snapshot address productivity, teamwork, potential, and risks. They are worded in such a way as to help the leader gather frequent, reliable data to know how they should respond to each person&#x2019;s performance."
36,"Is the Performance Snapshot confidential? - Yes. Performance Snapshots are only visible to the team leader (static or dynamic) who completes them. The Performance Snapshot is a simple, valid way to capture a team member&#x2019;s performance from the point of view of the people that work with them every day, the team leader. The team leader that entered the Performance Snapshot data is the only one who sees the data. Looking at data from the Snapshot questions over time, the leader will see a trend in performance that will provide them with the insight to know what they should do with each team member as a result. Because there is no forced distribution for single ratings, the data does not roll up to another leader. The team leader that entered it is the one that will make decisions about a team member, therefore they alone are uniquely qualified to see it."
37,"Can a senior leader see Performance Snapshot data for the entire organization? - No. The platform does not currently support aggregation of Performance Snapshot results. Only the team leader (static or dynamic) who entered the performance snapshot can see the data."
38,"How do team leaders complete a Performance Snapshot? - <span>Step 1: Log in to your Team Space account - </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://teamspace.cisco.com/" target="_blank">https://teamspace.cisco.com</a><br>Step 2: Select &apos;My Teams&apos;<br>Step 3: Select &apos;Performance Snapshot&apos;<br>Step 4: Select the team member you want to consider<br>Step 5: Answer the four questions for that team member specific to the period of time being considered (we recommend monthly)<br>Step 6: Add a private note to provide context for your answers (optional)<br>Step 7: Select Save<br>Step 8: Select the next team member until all team members are complete"
39,"How do team leaders use the Performance Snapshot data to make talent decisions? - The four questions in the Performance Snapshot are specifically designed to help inform talent decisions. Extensive research conducted by our Team Space partner, The Marcus Buckingham Company, proves these particularly questions capture productivity, teamwork, potential, and risks. They are data points into a dynamic view of our team members. Consider the &quot;array of intelligence&quot; that can help you take a view on performance, including attitude, aptitude, aspiration, experience, and behaviors. The goal of the Leadership and Team Intelligence team is to help team leaders look at the right things to reliably capture. We&#x2019;re also currently looking at how we do this outside of the Team Space platform. Stay tuned!"
51,"What should a team leader do about low performance or a mismatch between performance and expectations? - Remember Our People Deal and that we are building success from the view of promoting individual strengths to achieve team excellence. Be proactive about looking at your team&#x2019;s priorities and talking a lot about the work. Consider each team member&#x2019;s Strengths Profile so you can focus on finding high points and coaching to lift their performance. Ask yourself: how can you provide more clarity on the work and what&#x2019;s expected? What obstacles can you help remove? What resources can you provide? The goal is always to lift performance and achieve excellent results. If those strategies do not work, we still have the Corrective Action process.

52,"Where does a team leader document performance concerns? - Team leaders should use regular Check-Ins to let people know how they are doing against expectations in real-time. They should also complete regular Performance Snapshots to identify patterns or trends in the performance of their team members. You can also use the &#x2018;private note&#x2019; feature within the Performance Snapshot to provide context for yourself, and then use email to provide additional detail and clarity for the team member. The goal in any situation is to find high points of performance and scale it.

53,"Can I request feedback from others through Team Space? - Today, Team Space does not support in-platform feedback requests. Team leaders request feedback from the team by launching an Engagement Pulse and discussing the results with the team afterwards."
54,"What is a Static Team? - A formal reporting relationship to a team leader, intact team in the directory. Static Teams are automatically created and updated in Team Space. Learn more about <a class="jive-link-wiki-small" data-containerid="35217" data-containertype="700" data-objectid="1356650" data-objecttype="102" href="https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1356650#vid3">Static &amp; Dynamic teams</a>."
55,"What is a Dynamic Team? - Dynamic team are working, temporary project based teams that can be cross-functional, a group of people working towards a particular initiative or project spanning across organizations. Dynamic team leader (based on project or program relationships) can create and disband teams manually. Learn more about <a class="jive-link-wiki-small" data-containerid="35217" data-containertype="700" data-objectid="1356650" data-objecttype="102" href="https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1356650#vid3">Static &amp; Dynamic teams.</a>"
56,"Who is a Team Leader? - Individual providing guidance, instruction, direction and leadership to a group working towards a goal. Synonymous with people leader when a formal reporting relationship exists between the team members and the team leader."
57,"What is a strength-based development? - An approach to performance which focuses on developing a person most in his/her areas of strengths. A strength is defined as an activity that makes you feel strong and you are energized. In strengths-based development, people focus on meeting the expectations of their role and then maximize their own growth by focusing on those areas of strength."
58,"Can contingent workers use Team Space? - No. Contingent workers will not be provided access to Team Space. This decision supports contingent worker policies and co-employment laws."
60,"How are Teams created in Team Space? - Intact Static teams (your immediate team in the directory) are automatically created and updated in Team Space. Dynamic team leaders (based on project or program relationships) can create teams manually. Learn more about <a class="jive-link-wiki-small" data-containerid="35217" data-containertype="700" data-objectid="1356650" data-objecttype="102" href="https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1356650#vid3">Static &amp; Dynamic teams.</a>"
61,"What happens if a Team Member leaves or joins? Who can add or removes individuals from the platform? - Org changes in HRMS will be reflected in static teams automatically in Team Space. (This could take up to 24 hours.)Members of a dynamic team must be removed manually. The team leader can add/remove anyone. Team members can only remove themselves."
62,"What happens if I move to a new team? - If you move to a new team (and this change is reflected in the directory), you will automatically become a member of your new team. Your Check-In data stays with you, but your new team leader will not have access to your historical data."
